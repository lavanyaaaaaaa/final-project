Advanced Project: Multi-Stage Enterprise Network Penetration & Post-Exploitation
Project Overview:
You simulate a full-scope penetration test of an enterprise-style network with multiple segmented systems, realistic defenses, and layered privileges. This involves:

External network reconnaissance

Gaining initial access via web or network vulnerability

Pivoting through internal hosts

Privilege escalation on multiple machines

Data exfiltration simulation

Post-exploitation persistence and cleanup

Tools & Environment:
Lab Setup:

Use multiple vulnerable VMs from VulnHub or build a multi-VM lab using VirtualBox or VMware.

Include Windows and Linux machines with different roles (e.g., domain controller, file server, web server, user workstations).

Setup network segmentation (subnets or VLANs) if possible.

Tools:

Nmap, Masscan (scanning)

Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP (web app testing)

Metasploit, Empire, Cobalt Strike (exploitation & post-exploitation)

PowerShell, BloodHound (Active Directory enumeration)

ProxyChains, SSH tunneling (pivoting)

Mimikatz (credential harvesting)

LinPEAS/WinPEAS (privilege escalation scripts)

Project Stages & Deliverables:
1. External Recon & Initial Access
Perform wide scanning of external IP range to identify open services.

Identify vulnerabilities (e.g., outdated web app, exposed RDP).

Exploit a web vulnerability (SQL injection, file upload) or weak password on RDP/SSH.

Gain a foothold on a low-privilege user machine.

2. Internal Network Recon & Lateral Movement
From the compromised host, use port scanning and network discovery to identify internal machines.

Use tools like BloodHound to map AD relationships and identify high-value targets.

Harvest credentials using Mimikatz or similar.

Use harvested creds to pivot via RDP, SMB, or SSH to other hosts.

3. Privilege Escalation
Enumerate each host for privilege escalation vectors (misconfigurations, unpatched vulnerabilities).

Exploit local privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

Achieve domain admin or root-level access on critical machines.

4. Data Exfiltration Simulation
Identify sensitive files (database dumps, password files, intellectual property).

Simulate exfiltration by copying files to your attacker machine or uploading to a simulated C2 server.

5. Persistence & Cleanup
Deploy backdoors or scheduled tasks to maintain access.

Use techniques to hide presence (clear logs, timestomping).

Document steps for mitigation.

Final Deliverables:
Comprehensive penetration test report detailing:

Recon methods & findings

Exploits used & step-by-step shell access

Lateral movement & privilege escalation techniques

Data access and exfiltration proof

Persistence methods & cleanup

Recommendations for remediation and defense improvements

Network diagrams showing attack paths and pivot points.

Scripts or commands used during the test.

Why This Project?
Mimics real-world complex engagements, demonstrating advanced pentesting skills.

Covers external + internal network attacks, privilege escalation, persistence, and reporting.

Shows ability to think like an attacker and defender, essential for red team or advanced pentest roles.

Great for a portfolio or interview discussion with hands-on evidence.
